It is an excellent place where I gained not only practical knowledge but also great enjoyment from the work. During my internship, I became familiar with modern CMS platforms, learned frameworks such as TailwindCSS and Next.js, and developed a new perspective on UI/UX design. Working with the CMS Sanity allowed me to dive into the world of TypeScript for the first time. I would like to especially highlight the team I worked with: thanks to their support and expertise, I received a strong motivation for further learning and growth in the IT field.",
